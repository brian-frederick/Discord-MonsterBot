# Discord-MonsterBot

Monsterbot is a Discord Bot to support the playing of [Monster of The Week](https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/). It was built during the pandemic times (he writes, assuming these times may some day end...) to help our crew of first-time players stay in the action and out of the pages. It provides a bunch of shorthand commands to take the focus off of rules and onto outcomes. It worked well for our brave cohort of newbies and it might be useful to you. Monsterbot will allow you to load the characteristics of your hunter, roll basic moves while using their modifiers (tough, charm, etc), track your stats, and even create a little recap so you remember what you did last time. We're also working on the ability to load special moves outside of the basic "Kick Some Ass", etc. It's been fun for me to work on, helpful to our crew, and I'd be thrilled if it was useful to you as well. 

## Some Examples

Blake investigates a mystery. (Blake has 0 sharp so there's no additional help there.)

Tritt adds an item to his inventory.

Adolphus checks his stats.

And most valuably, help will give you detail about another command and all its additional options.

## Want to use Monsterbot?
To call upon the powers of monsterbot, send an email to brianfrederick@hey.com. There isn't a sales pitch coming. Monsterbot will be free unless something weird happens and all the sudden there's thousands of people blowing up my hosting bill. It's just not ready for primetime so I'd like to limit how many users we gain at once. Also, I want to make myself available for support. (Also for free.)
